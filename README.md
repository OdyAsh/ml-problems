Side note: it is recommended you paste the links of the notebook files to [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org/), as it displays the plotly graphs done in the notebooks.

Another side note: we could've written `fig.show("png")` instead of `fig.show()` for the [plotly images to be rendered in github](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/931#:~:text=Jul%2017%2C%202020-,Yes%2C%20check%20out%20the%20notebook%20I%20mentioned%20above%3A%20https%3A//github.com/nicolaskruchten/plotly_img_test/blob/master/Untitled.ipynb%20you%20just%20call%20fig.show(%22png%22)%20or%20fig.show(%22svg%22),-%F0%9F%91%8D)
, but that would've made it non-interactive, and we don't want that to happen :]
